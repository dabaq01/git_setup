vi. Comprehensive git and GitHub setup for beginners.

First off, it is advisable to search for the terminal commands for installing the "git"on your local computer. The command is; "sudo apt-get install git" because it has to be run by the super user for security reasons. It will run and install the git on your computer.
Secondly, you need to set up your GitHub account if you do not already have one. If you don't, search for the GitHub website and sign up with your email address and create a username and password. After that's done, set up your GitHub profile. You can add your name, photo, social links etc.
After that's done, you have to setup your SSH. 

Identity:
You start by setting your user name and email address. This is very vital as every Git commit uses this information, and itâ€™s immutably embedded into any commits you create.
On your terminal, input the following;
git config --global user.name "your-github-username"
this will set the user name
then input the following;
gitconfig --global user.email "your-email_address"
this will set your email address. you can check the changes using;
git config --list
this should display the username and email you just set up.

SSH Keygen:
Next up, you need to generate your ssh key. To do that, input the following on your terminal;
ssh keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email_address"
this should generate the key using the probided email as a label. you should keep that key safe. When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key", you can press Enter to accept the default file location. 
Next you start the ssh agent in the background by inputting the following in your terminal;
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
this should generate an agent pid number. you should also keep this safe.
Next you should input the following in your terminal;
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
this will add the ssh key to the private agent
then input the following:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
then copy the contents to your clipboard.
